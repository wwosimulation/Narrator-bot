# Narrator Bot

This bot is designed specifically for [Wolvesville Simulation](https://wovsimulation.xyz). Narrator Bot's main purpose is to automate much of what happens when we run a game of Wolvesville on Discord.  
It also runs the server economy and much of the more labor-intensive tasks in the server.

This bot was started in October of 2020 by Ashish who designed much of the core game functionality, and was transfered in March of 2021 to Shadow, who created the economy and completed the bot to release a couple months later.
